     <!--Lecture Talk: A scenario I can imagine using this is if you were to make a homework site that required answers, you would easily be able to keep track of the answers
     you got correct by clicking the success button, or make the primary button a help button that offers the student help with the problem they are currently doing. One last 
     way that this can be used is a simple quick message by using the notifcations class to let the person know when homework is due. With bootstrap, it saves
     a ton of time as you are able to quickly create buttons that are already styled.-->

    <!-- FontAwesome Section -->
     <!--I would use these Icons for fields that require you to input information, such as a sign in site, you can require the user to use special characters in their password, and 
     if they dont they will receive a text warning icon signaling they need to add one. You can also use text-danger icons in anti-virus software, if you are about to enter a unsafe site
     that may leak your information. FontAwesome makes it really easy to add cool effects to your text that change the appearance of your website greatly.-->

     <!--Prompt for in class: Animate.css would be a great tool to make your webpage flow very nice, and enhance the user experience. It definitely adds a more premium feel rather than 
     a completely static website as those get boring. A specific scenario I can imagine this being used in would be a "50 percent off" bouncing text, can draw the customers intention and 
     make them more inclined to purchasing the product.-->
